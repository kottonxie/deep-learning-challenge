# deep-learning-challenge

For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

## Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
⋅⋅* For the model, we are targeting the variables: CLASSIFICATION & APPLICATION_TYPE

2. What variable(s) are the features for your model?
⋅⋅* For the model, the variable(s) for the features for the model could be the INCOME_AMT or ASK_AMT!

3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
⋅⋅* Dropped the EIN and NAME columns, as these columns are not considered as either the target or feature variables.


## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
⋅⋅*

5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
⋅⋅*

6. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
⋅⋅*
